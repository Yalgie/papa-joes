# Papa Joes Pizerria

This game started as a game entry for a Game Jam. My friend [h3xmode](http://www.h3xmode.xyz/) did all the incredible pixel art and I built out the game with Phaser JS.

Unfortunately it was one of those things were as time went on we just eventually stopped working on it. I hope to finish it one day, but for now you can play it here: [https://thecodingforge.com.au/work/papajoe/](https://thecodingforge.com.au/work/papajoe/)
